06/07/2021, 15:00 - Kumar Bha: One Fact which i learnt from my experience....

*Stock Market is all about your conviction based on your defined rules with discipline*

Money, you only get it by following the process..
06/07/2021, 15:04 - Kumar Bha: And also, Decide your role in stock market
1) Intraday Player
2) Positional Player
3) Investor

Each role will have definite set of rules and conditions...
06/07/2021, 15:06 - Kumar Bha: This message was deleted
06/07/2021, 15:09 - Kumar Bha: Let me explain with TAMO example

Assume that you entered into TAMO Today Morning  9:15

1) Intraday Player--> You should have exited either with profit of 10 rs or exit with the loss of 1 Rs
2) Positional Player--> You should have added more, when it hits LC i.e. 311
3) Investor--> Doesn't need to check the chart daily, you need check the chart only weekly or Mnthly basis...
06/07/2021, 15:10 - Kumar Bha: Hope it make sense....and decide your role today...
06/07/2021, 15:10 - PJ: okay

07/07/2021, 10:44 - Kumar Bha: Still waiting for answers
07/07/2021, 10:45 - Kumar Bha: Let me put my thought process for TAMO
07/07/2021, 10:47 - Kumar Bha: Everyone know that there is shortage of Semiconductors for luxury cars...

So, yesterday's fall could have been equally distributed across all auto companies... But Why TAMO is only got affected and loss the momentum  hit LC..?
07/07/2021, 10:48 - Pulical: <Media omitted>
07/07/2021, 10:49 - Pulical: Reason bro🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
07/07/2021, 10:50 - PJ: Yes
07/07/2021, 10:50 - Kumar Bha: Because, they are the most affected because of shortage... As they might have huge deliveries and affecting the delivery dates.. which leaves a bad impression to the end user...

So my view is, as they got bulk orders which they have to fulfill and which inturn generates revenue and which inturn declares good results and which inturn increase share price to 400-600... Sooner or later
07/07/2021, 10:50 - PJ: Tata owns someother automobiles

07/07/2021, 10:51 - Pulical: Yes as per researchers target  is 405 in month of aug

07/07/2021, 10:53 - PJ: If everyone gets vaccinated, factories will open, hence more chips prodution
07/07/2021, 10:53 - Kumar Bha: Temporary problem... And it will get resolve very soon....
07/07/2021, 10:55 - Kumar Bha: Hope you get my point... I am still waiting for a dip in TAMO... For a re entry....
07/07/2021, 10:55 - PJ: US and taiwan are the top two countries generates chips

09/07/2021, 12:52 - PJ: i dont buy a car at 10L
09/07/2021, 12:53 - PJ: no good features
09/07/2021, 12:53 - Jai Simha: 😂😂😂
09/07/2021, 12:53 - Kumar Bha: Now.. Everyone has their own priority and their own requirements for selecting a car..
09/07/2021, 12:53 - Pulical: Labbe ga nuvvu unnodive lee 10 cr pette rakam nuvvu

09/07/2021, 12:55 - Pulical: <Media omitted>
09/07/2021, 12:56 - Kumar Bha: Now... Let me ask you the same question with following assumptions

Currently India is having only one car manufacturer... And they dont have any cars for below 10 L

Now what will be your answer??
09/07/2021, 12:56 - PJ: add some more amount
09/07/2021, 12:56 - PJ: and buy
09/07/2021, 12:56 - Pulical: Add some amount or go for 2nd hand🤷🏻‍♂️
09/07/2021, 12:56 - Pulical: If it is really necessary
09/07/2021, 12:57 - Jai Simha: Ha anthe
09/07/2021, 12:57 - Manoj Kumar: Wait chestha bro
09/07/2021, 12:57 - Kumar Bha: Point to be noted...
09/07/2021, 12:57 - Jai Simha: Price taggadanika?
09/07/2021, 12:57 - Jai Simha: Car price kuda tagguthundha @918297125901
09/07/2021, 12:57 - Manoj Kumar: Price kadu ra
09/07/2021, 12:58 - Pulical: Money save chesukovadani anta🤭
09/07/2021, 12:58 - Jai Simha: Sare sare
09/07/2021, 12:58 - Pulical: Extra money
09/07/2021, 13:00 - Kumar Bha: Now.. Some people are not willing to buy the car itself... and some people are going for second hand, some people are putting extramoney and will go for a car.....

If i were you, i would wait for the car price to go below 10L... 

Now we need to think, when will that happen?? any answers??
09/07/2021, 13:01 - PJ: it will happen when no one buys it
09/07/2021, 13:01 - PJ: or company is not much reputated
09/07/2021, 13:02 - Pulical: If demand goes down then price will automatically go down🤷🏻‍♂️ to attract more customers,  or if there any competitors in that price segment then they should obviously reduce price
09/07/2021, 13:02 - Jai Simha: Company medha negative impact emina untae and buyers lekuntae and quarterly growth down avvuthe…
09/07/2021, 13:03 - Kumar Bha: Exactly the second point... Competition...
09/07/2021, 13:03 - PJ: ante ippudu zomato just attracting
09/07/2021, 13:03 - Jai Simha: Yes
09/07/2021, 13:04 - Kumar Bha: Now you guys must know.. why i am not interested for Zomato IPO....
09/07/2021, 13:04 - Jai Simha: Got it got it bro

09/07/2021, 13:05 - Pulical: Yes bro nenu zomato gurinchi kadhu cheptondi, it will affect most of hotels and restaurants in which is indirect.
09/07/2021, 13:06 - Manoj Kumar: Exactly wait cheyyadam manaku ok anipinchinappudu konadam
09/07/2021, 13:07 - Pulical: After ipo listing zomato price may hit its peak and automatically follow pattern(goes down) like burger King
09/07/2021, 13:07 - Pulical: This is what i am thinking
09/07/2021, 13:08 - Kumar Bha: the main business of Zomato is food delivery.... and there is no other stock which listed  under food delivery category.... So Zomato saying my Initial offer is 15 InR or some thing else... but i need a competitor to compare the price in stock market.... and there is no one in the same business...so.. i am not interested to buy.....

again.. it may listed high in Gray market... it may go high from initial level... but this is my view only...
09/07/2021, 13:08 - Pulical: And zomato also announced that they will be delivering groceries , where there are services
09/07/2021, 13:09 - PJ: what if swiggy enters too
09/07/2021, 13:09 - Jai Simha: Same pattern repeats
09/07/2021, 13:09 - Pulical: My view is exactly opposite,🤣🤣 as there is no oppositions, it may with stand till competitors arrive
09/07/2021, 13:10 - Kumar Bha: Then you need to question your self.... do i really need a car??
09/07/2021, 13:10 - Pulical: I may not be correct 😅
09/07/2021, 13:11 - PJ: sare ok.. tmrw 7pm session @919940016536

31/08/2021, 10:08 - Kumar Bha: New Margin rules from 01-09-2021

SEBI margin rules explain in layman’s language:

SEBI has changed some rules related to margin and trading. 

1) Buying and selling of shares will Require Upfront margin from now onwards.

Eg: If you want to buy Reliance shares worth 1lakh, you must have 20k Rs in your account as cash and the rest money to be paid within 2 days...

👆🏻 Major Change If you want to sell 1 lac worth of Reliance shares from your holdings for that scenario also you must have min 20k rs in your account. Failing which penalties will be levied.

👆🏻 Read Carefully... Selling from holding will also require Upfront margin in cash (Var+ELM).

You can keep extra cash or can pledge other holdings for the stipulated margin required.

2) Shares bought today cannot be sold Tomorrow. 

Implications:  BTST Closed

Eg You bought Reliance On Monday. You can only sell those shares after receiving the delivery of shares. T+2 you can sell on Wednesday.

You can only sell the shares after you receive in Your DP/only after receiving the delivery of shares.

3) Shares Sold Today from delivery..... the funds cannot be used for new trades today. You can use the funds for new trades the next day.

Eg:🌟 You sold 100,000 Rs worth of Reliance's shares today. 
👆🏻You cannot use this money to buy fresh shares of other companies. 

No changes In options and Futures Rules for Now Till further Notice.

29/09/2021, 10:14 - Kumar Bha: Case for Tata Power & IEX - Potential next decade emerging stocks!! (Note from domestic brokerage)
In summary, the Amendment Bill 2021 says:
⚡️ Delicensing of state monopoly- open to competition
⚡️ Consumers can choose discoms (like telcos)
⚡️ Smart meters to plug leakages
⚡️ Easy resolution of disputes
⚡️ Right to 24x7 electricity
⚡️ Rewarding consumers shifting to solar
India has one of the largest and most complex power sectors in the world. Last 2 decades saw gradual evolution - grid electricity, lesser power cuts, increase in renewables.

If the Bill is passed, the next decade can well be a decade of power renaissance.

30/09/2021, 19:50 - Kumar Bha: But as per me... Index shot up... But many stocks didn't break their 52 Weeks high... I will only assume that if 90 out 100 stocks are hit their 52 Weeks high along with index, Then I will consider that as top for our market....
30/09/2021, 19:55 - Kumar Bha: On the other side,Why so much volatility from past three days....?


Because, FIIs and DIIs are very strong to protect their levels... Hence we are facing huge volatile moves...

FII net sellers today so, they think that 18000 shouldn't cut at any case... 

DII net buyers yesterday and they don't want Nifty to break 17500 ...


 And hence I gave 17500 OCT call option to buy... With 80 Points SL..

So trust me... If 80 Points saved in October... I will show you 1000 in that option.... 👍👍
30/09/2021, 19:56 - Kumar Bha: And if you see... Some informed traders are selling 19000 put option in the October month series...

01/10/2021, 17:17 - PJ: No BIG explanation..


Simple answer..


Awareness is increasing everyday..


Whatever happens Globally.. rotates on all channels everywhere..


I was somehow thinking.. it will fall after kicking out all..


and they just did time pass full day..


When candle at 3:00 PM came..


Many would have exited..


and next candle onwards.. again downside.. 😉


In short..


Answer is of 2 lines..


When everyone is expecting.. No BIG fall will happen..


When no one will be expecting.. BIG fall will happen..


Simple..


Nothing else..


Otherwise everyone would become Rich.. isn't it..??


You can call it psychology / kicking out / Movement against majority or whatever..


Nothing much to explain..

08/10/2021, 10:03 - Pulical: You can enter 50%
08/10/2021, 10:08 - Kumar Bha: My theory is so simple.. Assume that I bought IRCTC shares at  1500*50
And the stock splits at 5000 as 1:5...
I.e. I have 250 shares in my account...with price of 1000..

Now, any newbie will think that 1000 rs is an affordable price... He will also join and his likelyhood as well..

That makes share price to hit UC for multiple days.... Let's say 1300...

Then I will think that let's book some profit and I will sell 100 shares @1300.. I almost got my initial investment in IRCTC.. and I will leave my profit runs forever...

So, that makes share price give a dip.... 👍👍 

Sorry for long message.. hope you get the point...
08/10/2021, 10:10 - Kumar Bha: And there is no hard n fast rule for the same...

How do you understand it's journey....?
It was trading at 360 few months back... All of sudden *news* came and fell 100 Rs...

This is the point all flies, birds etc  were kicked out...


And after that time pass for few weeks.. gained the momentum slowly and reached its original level of 360...

After that what happens we know...

The point here is, if a quality share dips more than 10%... then it should be considered as best buying opportunity.. if it dips more than 20%... keep adding more... Sooner or later it will reach to it's original point..
 

If a quality share finds a dip of 30% all of sudden because of some problem .. then... You need to analyse the problem... Whether the problem is temporary one or permanent one... 
Hope you like it..
👍👍👍

 The problem will be with the ones who entered at higher levels like 5000-6000

If yes.. then we might see a fall of 300 points.. if  not recovered, then we might end up + or - 20 tomorrow..

20/10/2021, 18:05 - Kumar Bha: My point is so simple... Just assume that if a stock is trading at 100 rs and after 3 years, we found that it is at 10000 rs... means 100 times....

Now what you think, 100 to 10000 in 3 years... and 10000. to 1000000 in next 3 years or 6 years...
